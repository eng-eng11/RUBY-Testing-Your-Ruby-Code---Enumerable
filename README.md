# PROJECT: TESTING YOUR RUBY CODE - Enumerable

This is our solution to Microverse's fifth Ruby project. In this project we use RSpec to test the code for a Enumerable method. The approach used was TDD (Test Driven Development).

The project description can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/testing-your-ruby-code).

A demo for the project can be found [here](https://repl.it/@DavidAuza/PROJECT-TESTING-YOUR-RUBY-CODE-Enumerable).
